    <emphasis level="strong">Step 1. Make.com Registration.</emphasis>

    If you have not already done so, register a new Make.com account.

    <break time="500ms"/>
    <emphasis level="strong">Step 2. Initial Login.</emphasis>

    Once you have completed the registration process and login to Make.com for the first time, you will be presented with a My Organization dashboard.

    <emphasis level="strong">Step 3. Create a D.T. Site Link.</emphasis>

    A site-link token shall be required, in order to successfully establish a connection between Disciple Tools and Make.com.

    Ensure the Token As Transfer Key is selected; whilst also making a note of generated Token; which will be required a little later.

    <emphasis level="strong">Step 4. Make.com Scenario Configuration.</emphasis>

    Return back to the Make.com Dashboard and create a new scenario.

    A very simple scenario workflow shall be created; which processes a Google Spreadsheet, populated by Google Form responses. Then, creates a new D.T record using the Disciple Tools Create Post Type Record module.

    First, create the Google step within the scenario workflow.

    Next, we shall create the D.T step, by searching for the Disciple Tools custom application.

    Then, select the Create Post Type Record module and add.

    Create a connection to the target D.T instance and fill out URL, API and Post Type information.

    Now, map the presented D.T post type fields against the incoming fields from the connected module and save scenario settings.

    <emphasis level="strong">Step 5. Make.com Scenario Workflow Run.</emphasis>

    In order to test our workflow, simply click the Run once option in the bottom-left corner of the editor view.

    On a successful run, all modules should be in a green state.

    View module outputs to sanity check processed data.

    <break time="500ms"/>
    <emphasis level="strong">Step 6. D.T. Created Record Sanity Check.</emphasis>

    As a final sanity check, navigate to your D.T. instance and confirm submitted record has indeed been created.

    Congratulations, as you now have a functioning Make.com scenario workflow!

    From this point forward, you are free to explore integrating the D.T. Create module with other apps more suitable to your use case.
