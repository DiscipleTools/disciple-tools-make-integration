    Return back to the Make.com Dashboard and create a new scenario.

    A very simple scenario workflow shall be created; which processes a Google Spreadsheet, populated by Google Form responses. Then, creates a new D.T record using the Disciple Tools Create Post Type Record module.

    First, create the Google step within the scenario workflow.

    Next, we shall create the D.T step, by searching for the Disciple Tools custom application.

    Then, select the Create Post Type Record module and add.

    Create a connection to the target D.T instance and fill out URL, API and Post Type information.

    Now, map the presented D.T post type fields against the incoming fields from the connected module and save scenario settings.
